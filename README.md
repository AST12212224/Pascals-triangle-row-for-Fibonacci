# Pascals-triangle-row-for-Fibonacci
A new way to compute Fibonacci numbers using a row of Pascal's Triangleâ€”not via shallow diagonals, but through specific permutations of its coefficients. Out of \(3^n\) possible combinations per row (where *n* is the number of coefficients), only a few produce the correct Fibonacci term.
